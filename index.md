description: Stephen Spalding is an Engineer that enjoys large-scale distributed systems

well: Through developing software for Nuclear Reactors, 3d X-ray machines,
  OpenTable's messaging system, and Netflix's API I've learned the value of simplicity
  and robustness. I believe in leading through earned respect and mutual trust.
  I enjoy solving problems that don't have solutions.
